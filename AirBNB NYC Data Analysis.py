# The above chart highlights the neighbourhood comparison. We can state that the popular neighbourhoods are too expensive for certain tourists, they might prefer staying at Airbnbs in neighbourhoods that are comparatively cheaper and closer to locations like Manhattan.

# Types of rooms according to neighbourhood groups
labels = df.room_type.value_counts().index
values = df.room_type.value_counts().values
fig = px.pie(df, values=values, names=labels, title = "Airbnb Rooms According to Neighbourhood Group")
fig.show()


# Here, we notice that not many prefer shared rooms. Families of more than 4 people might choose an entire home/apartment over a single room. Since the percentage of an entire home/apartments is greater, we can conclude that majority of tourists are a family of more than 2 people and the other portion, a private room would be for couples and single travellers.

df2 = df.loc[(df['price']<300) & (df['reviews_per_month']<10)]

fig.show()


# In[42]:


fig = px.bar(df, x= df.number_of_reviews[:50], y = df.neighbourhood[:50] )
fig.show()


# For low price airbnbs, there are some reviews. However, if the prices were high here, we'd see less reviews per month. Not very helpful to have such little reviews. Thus, we may conclude that there is no strong relationship between the reviews per month and price.

# There is a sharp drop in prices (around $200) after Tribeca. Rest both charts seem to have similar prices respectively.

The old industrial buildings turned residential lofts are picture perfect locations for many people.

# Great, with a statistical table and a violin plot we can definitely observe a couple of things about distribution of prices for Airbnb in NYC boroughs. First, we can state that Manhattan has the highest range of prices for the listings with $150 price as average observation, followed by Brooklyn with \$90 per night. Queens and Staten Island appear to have very similar distributions, Bronx is the cheapest of them all. This distribution and density of prices were completely expected; for example, as it is no secret that Manhattan is one of the most expensive places in the world to live in, where Bronx on other hand appears to have lower standards of living.

# # Consulation
# 
# ### Focus on Neighbourhoods/Neighbourhood_Group :
# Manhattan and Brooklyn have the most listings & customers, Staten Island has the busiest hosts, particularly in Silver Lake, Eltingville and Richmondtown. This is due to less competition, very low costs compared to other boroughs and less minimum night requirements which drives more customers.
# 
# ### Focus on Room-Types & Prices :
#  Private rooms and Entire homes are the most common listings while Shared rooms are much less.
#  Entire homes normally cost around 160 dollars
#  Private rooms cost around 70 dollars
#  Shared rooms cost around 45 dollars
#  Manhattan has the most expensive listings while Staten Island has the cheapest listings.
#  
# ### Focus on Review Rate :
# Althoough Manhattan has a lot of private rooms & entire homes available, many people tend to opt for the   shared rooms, possibly due to lower cost and travelling alone.
# Entire homes seem to be the go to option for most visitors in Staten Island and Bronx.
# There is no significant difference for reviews_per_month between hosts of 'shared rooms' and 'private rooms' (with a 95% confidence)
